# Gmail AI Agent Design

## System Architecture

### 1. Core Components
1. **Gmail API Integration**
   - Use Gmail API for authentication and email access
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure access
   - Scope: read and send emails
   - Functions:
     - Fetch latest 10 emails
     - Send responses
     - Handle attachments (optional)

2. **AI Engine (Using OpenAI)**
   - Email analysis and response generation
   - Natural language instruction processing
   - Context-aware responses
   - Functions:
     - Analyze email content and context
     - Generate appropriate responses based on instructions
     - Maintain conversation history if needed

### 2. Technical Stack
- Python 3.9+
- Key Libraries:
  - google-api-python-client (Gmail API)
  - google-auth-oauthlib (Authentication)
  - openai (GPT integration)
  - python-dotenv (environment management)

### 3. Natural Language Instructions
Instead of rigid rules, the system uses natural language instructions like:
```text
- If it's a meeting request, check if it's during work hours (9 AM - 5 PM) and respond accordingly
- For customer support emails, be polite and ask for more details if needed
- For newsletter subscriptions, politely decline
- If someone asks for a quote, request more project details
```

### 4. Process Flow
1. **Authentication**
   - One-time Gmail OAuth setup
   - Secure credential storage

2. **Email Processing**
   - Fetch latest 10 unread emails
   - Extract relevant information:
     - Sender
     - Subject
     - Content
     - Timestamp
     - Thread context

3. **AI Analysis & Response**
   - Send email content to GPT
   - Include natural language instructions
   - Generate contextual response
   - Validate response format

4. **Send Response**
   - Queue email for sending
   - Apply rate limiting
   - Log the interaction

### 5. Security Considerations
- Secure credential storage
- Rate limiting for both Gmail and OpenAI APIs
- Content validation before sending
- Error handling and notifications
